Trackmania Backwards Guide

What is backwards?
---

In trackmania, backwards is a driving/mapping style. At first glance, driving backwards is just slow and boring. But due to the many tricks like speeddrifts and noslides that have a huge impact on acceleration. Combined with the much sharper turning radius, it can quickly turn into a very fast paced style that is notoriously difficult to learn and master.

This guide aims to collect and combine all backwards knowledge to give new players an easier time to learn and improve at this unique style.
