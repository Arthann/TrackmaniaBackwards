# Reverse Gear

To engage reverse gear, make sure the following conditions are met:
- The player is holding the brake/reverse input.
- The car is traveling at a speed of less than 100.
- The engine's RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) is high enough.
- The car has sufficient grip.

It's important to note that pressing the gas pedal will instantly shift the car back into forwards gear. If you're having trouble with speeddrifts, it's possible that the car is in neutral gear.
