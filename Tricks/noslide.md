# Noslide SD

The Noslide SD, or Skidboost, technique involves generating skidmarks without sliding. This technique can provide higher acceleration when steering and is effective on various surfaces except ice.

**Road Surface:**

- On the road, canceling a slide with precise timing and steering again in the same direction can yield anywhere from 1 to 4 skidmarks. Most commonly, the car will generate 2 skidmarks.

- While in a slide, full steering in the opposite direction to cancel it at around 350 speed will give a single skid. Full steering at 370 speed will also produce a single skid. It's important to make harsh steering changes for effective use of this technique.

**Other Surfaces (Except Ice):**

- Nosliding on other surfaces also works and is very powerful, but it often requires analog steering to maximize its effectiveness. This can put keyboard players at a disadvantage, as precise analog steering control is needed to get the most out of this technique.

- Most useful when a turn is too tight to perform a normal speeddrift.
