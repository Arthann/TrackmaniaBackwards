# Speeddrift

Speeddrifting is a technique that involves sliding with a specific overlap of skidmarks to maximize acceleration. It is effective on various surfaces except ice.

- **Road Surface:** On the road, speeddrifting is most effective when there is a large gap between skidmarks at low speeds. This means a negative overlap of around 100% is preferred at speeds as low as 150. As speed increases, the overlap gradually decreases, and at high speeds, around 50% overlap is ideal, helping you maintain control and acceleration.

- **Dirt Surface:** When speeddrifting on dirt, aim for an overlap of approximately 50%. Similar to the road, the overlap should change gradually as your speed increases, allowing for effective acceleration while maintaining control.

- **Grass Surface:** On grass, speeddrifting requires a higher overlap of around 75%. This overlap also changes gradually with increasing speed, ensuring you can accelerate effectively without losing control.

- **Plastic Surface:** Plastic surfaces require an even higher overlap of approximately 90%. Just like the other surfaces, this overlap should gradually change with speed, allowing you to harness the power of speeddrifting on plastic tracks.
